Spree Extra Promotion Coupons
==========================

#### The current master branch uses Spree 2-2-stable

This extension includes some of the coupons that I have already develop
for some sites the list about coupon codes are:

#### Promotion coupon for product with option values

This means that you can apply for example a discount to all the products
that have a specific option values if you know a little about Spree you
know that an option value can be the size(small, large, extra large,
etc) or a color also can be an option value maybe for women or men and now you can give a discount to
all the products that include one of those option values that you select
from the admin section

#### New calculator action to set a price for products promotion

Now if you select this new action type 'Set a price for the product' now
if the rules for the coupon apply for a product now you can specify the
exact price you wan to offer that product or those products

#### If you want to see how you can use it take a look at this video:
